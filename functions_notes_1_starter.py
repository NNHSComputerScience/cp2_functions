# A FUNCTION is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task.
#   Functions allow you to abstract away unnecessary information and leverage modular design.
#   Built-in functions we know: print(), input(), len(), random.randint(), etc.

#  ABSTRACTION is hiding all but the most relevant details.
#   Lets you think about the big picture without worrying about the details.
#   e.g. variable or function names are an abstraction of their actual contents.


# 1: Creating a function is referred to as...
# FUNCTION DEFINITION is the entire function, both header and body.
# ...

# 2: Using a function is referred to as
#    "Calling a function"
# ...

# 3: DOCSTRING. A special way to document a function;
#    It must be triple quoted, and on the first line.  Can provide
#    useful info when attempting to use the function.
# ...

# 4: PARAMETERS: Variable names inside the parentheses of a
#      function header. A function receives a value through its
#      parameters. Parameters catch values sent to the function
#      from a function call.
#    ARGUMENTS: Values sent to a function to use. (put in parentheses of a
#      function call)
# ...

# Trap... If I define a function with one parameter, then I must
#       use the same number of arguments when calling the function

# 5 You can have multiple parameters:
# ...

# 6: You can get values out of a function by returning value(s).
#    You can return a value from a function by using
#    the RETURN STATEMENT. A function always ends after
#    executing a return statement, and the RETURN VALUE is returned.
# ...

# You can return any type of value in a function
# ...

# CHALLENGE 1: Can you define a function that can simulate
#           the rolling of two dies and return both values?
# ...

# CHALLENGE 2: Create a new function to add your two die rolls
#           together and return the total.
# ...
